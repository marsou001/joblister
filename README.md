This is an old project that I've done a while ago while learning PHP.

It is a follow up from [Brad Traversy's tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEkjrQMmIK0).

This app allows users to create, read, update, and delete a job listing with ease (CRUD).

It is built with Bootstrap on the front-end, while the back-end is built using PHP and MySQL as a database management system.

The layout is not very good, I know, but the focus here was on learning PHP, and the template I've used is already too old.
